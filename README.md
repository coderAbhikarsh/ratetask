# Initial setup

## Prerequisites:
1) You must have docker running on your system. No need to run the build commands as it
will be taken care by the application.
2) Try to use an IDE (Intellij, PyCharm, Visual Studio, etc.) to setup the application as it provides creation of virtual environment
and source root addition to PYTHONPATH out of the box.

## Steps:-
1) Make sure docker is up and running on your system.
2) After cloning the repository in an IDE, run the following command from the root directory:-
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3) Start the application by running the `app.py` file.
